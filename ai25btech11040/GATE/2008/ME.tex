\textbf{Read the following instructions carefully}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item This question paper contains \textbf{24} printed pages including pages for rough work. Please check all pages and report discrepancy, if any.
    \item Write your registration number, your name and name of the examination centre at the specified locations on the right half of the ORS.
    \item Using HB pencil, darken the appropriate bubble under each digit of your registration number and the letters corresponding to your paper code.
    \item All the questions in this question paper are of objective type.
    \item Questions must be answered on \textbf{O}bjective \textbf{R}esponse \textbf{S}heet (\textbf{ORS}) by darkening the appropriate bubble (marked A, B, C, D) using HB pencil against the question number on the left hand side of the ORS. \textbf{Each question has only one correct answer}. In case you wish to change an answer, erase the old answer completely. More than one answer bubbled against a question will be treated as a wrong answer.
    \item Questions 1 through 20 are 1-mark questions and questions 21 through 85 are 2-mark questions.
    \item Questions 71 through 73 is one set of common data questions. The question pairs (76, 77), (78, 79), (80, 81), (82, 83) and (84, 85) are questions with linked answers. The answer to the second question of the above pairs will depend on the answer to the first question of the pair. If the first question in the linked pair is wrongly answered or is un-attempted, then the answer to the second question will not be evaluated.
    \item Unattempted questions will carry zero marks.
    \item \textbf{NEGATIVE MARKING}: For Q.1 to Q.20, 0.25 mark will be deducted for each wrong answer. For Q.21 to Q.75, 0.5 mark will be deducted for each wrong answer. For the pairs of questions with linked answers, there will be negative marks only for wrong answer to the first question, i.e. for Q.76, Q.78, Q.80, Q.82 and Q.84, 0.5 mark will be deducted for each wrong answer. There is no negative marking for Q.77, Q.79, Q.81, Q.83 and Q.85.
    \item Calculator \textbf{without data connectivity} is allowed in the examination hall.
    \item Charts, graph sheets and tables are NOT allowed in the examination hall.
    \item Rough work can be done on the question paper itself. Additional blank pages are given at the end of the question paper for rough work.
