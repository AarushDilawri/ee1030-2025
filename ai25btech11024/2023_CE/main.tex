\item The James Webb telescope, recently launched in space, is giving humankind
unprecedented access to the depths of time by imaging very old stars formed almost 13 billion years ago. Astrophysicists and cosmologists believe that this odyssey in space may even shed light on the existence of dark matter.

This may justify the epithet “dark” in dark matter.\\

\begin{enumerate}
    \item No other telescope has captured images of stars older than those captured by the James Webb telescope.
    \item People other than astrophysicists and cosmologists may also believe in the existence of dark matter.
